---

## 2. Installation Steps

### 2.1 Copy the SharePoint Integration Folder
1. Unzip the `ItinerWorkspaceService_SharePointIntegration_spfile-x.x.x.ZIP`.
2. Copy the `SharePointIntegration` folder to `D:\ItinerWorkspace\`.

---

## 3. SharePoint Integration Setup

### 3.1 Required Files
Ensure the following files exist in the `SharePointIntegration` folder:
- `runtimes` folder
- `.dll` files
- `appsettings.json`
- `ProtocolSPFileIntegrationWebhook` file
- `.deps` files
- `appsettings.json`
- `Web.config`

### 3.2 IIS Application Pool
1. Open IIS Manager.
2. Create a new application pool:
   - Name: `ItinerWorkspace_SharePointIntegration` (or custom)
   - .NET CLR Version: No Managed Code
   - Managed Pipeline Mode: Integrated

### 3.3 Add IIS Web Application - Website Configuration
Install the SharePoint Integration on the same site as Itiner Workspace (e.g., `Default Website`).
1. Open IIS Manager.
2. Add a new web application with the following settings:
   - **Alias**: `SharePointIntegration`
   - **Application Pool**: Select the previously created pool (e.g., `ItinerWorkspace_SharePointIntegration`).
   - **Physical Path**: `D:\ItinerWorkspace\SharePointIntegration`

### 3.4 Configuration
Edit the `appsettings.json` file with the following parameters:
> ðŸ’¡ For reference, see the `sharepoint_integration_appsettings_sample.json` file located in the GitHub repository.

#### Host Configuration
```json
"Host": {
  "WebHostUrl": "https://addonhost/workspace/spfileintegration",
  "WSUrl": "http://workspacehost/workspace/api",
  "WsApiKey": "test", // API key generated for integration user
  "HealthCheckBaseUrl": "http://addonhost", // optional
  "CustomApiKey": "test",
  "PathBase": "/workspace/spfileintegration",
  "DebugMode": false,
  "DisableRequestLog": false,
  "DisableMetadata": true,
  "VariablePrefix": "" // Ensures compatibility when the workflow sending events to the integration service is an embedded workflow and uses prefixed variable names.
},
"Storage": {
        "Password": "test" // This password has to match with the storage.password value in the Workspace appsettings.json
    },
```

#### SharePoint Specific Settings
`SharePoint/SiteUrl`: URL of the SharePoint site (e.g., `https://domain.sharepoint.com/sites/sitename`).

Choose **either** NTLM **or** Token authentication by setting the relevant section. Do **not** set both.
Token authentication requires a registered MS Azure application. 
For information see: [Register an App in Microsoft Identity Platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app?tabs=certificate).

**NTLM Authentication**:
```json
"Auth": {
  "NTLM": {
    "Username": "username",
    "Password": "password",
    "Domain": "domain"
  }
}
```

**Token Authentication**:
```json
"Auth": {
  "Token": {
    "ClientId": "MS Azure Application ID",
    "ClientSecret": "Value of Client secret",
    "Scope": "https://domain.sharepoint.com/.default",
    "TenantId": "MS Azure application tenant id",
    "UserName": "username",
    "Password": "password"
  }
}
```

#### Reference Filter Configuration
- **Purpose**: Controls which events the integration service processes based on the `Reference` value in the event.
- **Behavior**:
  - If the `Filter` list is **not empty**, the integration service will **only process events** that contain a reference included in the `Filter` list.
  - If the `Filter` list is **empty**, the service will process **all events**, regardless of their `Reference` value.
- **Usage**: Populate the `Filter` list with user-defined keys to restrict the scope of processed events.

```json
"Reference": {
  "Filter": ["Email"]
},
```

#### Logging (Serilog) Configuration
```json
"Serilog": {
  "Using": ["Serilog.Sinks.Seq"],
  "LevelSwitches": {
    "$controlSwitch": "Information"
  },
  "MinimumLevel": {
    "ControlledBy": "$controlSwitch",
    "Override": {
      "System": "Warning",
      "Microsoft": "Error"
    }
  },
  "WriteTo": [{
    "Name": "Seq",
    "Args": {
      "serverUrl": "http://global_seq:5341",
      "apiKey": ""
    }
  }],
  "Enrich": ["FromLogContext", "WithMachineName", "WithThreadId"],
  "Properties": {
    "Application": "EmailWorker"
  }
}
```

---

## 4. Logging
By default, logs are sent to an SEQ server. Optionally, configure file or database logging as needed.

---

## 5. Restart
After completing the setup, restart the application pool in IIS Manager to apply the changes.

---

## 6. Updating the SharePoint Integration
1. **Stop** the application pool in IIS Manager.
2. Replace the existing `SharePointIntegration` folder with the updated version.
3. If required, modify the `appsettings.json` file and add any new keys provided.
4. **Restart** the application pool to activate the updated configuration.
